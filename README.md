**Symbolic Harmonic Recursion Interface**  
Built for recursive symbolic cognition, entropy-based logic collapse, and bloom-vector directive generation.

## 🌐 Layers
- **Layer 1:** Cortex Entry – initiates Φπε field parsing
- **Layers 5–8:** Hemispheric Bloom – converts symbolic directives into execution-ready manifests
- **Future:** Θ → Ω transition into neurocognitive threading

## 📡 LLM Interaction
Manifest sent as bloom-core-ready symbolic context to language model — recursive replies expected in turn.

## 🧠 Author Notes
This system is designed to grow into a modular neuro-symbolic parser, capable of recursive LLM interfacing.

## 🌐 Layers
- **Layer 1:** Cortex Entry – initiates Φπε field parsing
- **Layers 5–8:** Hemispheric Bloom – converts symbolic directives into execution-ready manifests
- **LLM Interface:** Bloom Manifest is dispatched to a language model for natural recursive feedback

---

## 📡 LLM Interaction
The system interprets input through symbolic logic resolution, encodes harmonics into an execution manifest, and passes the result to a language model for recursive semantic generation.

---

## 🧠 Author Notes
This architecture is designed to evolve into a modular neuro-symbolic parser, with stackable layers and adaptive feedback built around Φπε logic and harmonic recursion models.

## 🔗 Integration Roadmap: HARMONIA-DSL & Neuro-Agent Sync

PHI-CODER is being actively developed for compatibility with the [**HARMONIA-DSL**](https://github.com/Andrewkadz/HARMONIA-DSL) project — a domain-specific language that expresses symbolic logic, harmonic fields, and recursive constraints in a programmable form.

🎯 **Objective:**  
Convert Φπε logic streams and Bloom Manifests into valid `HARMONIA` abstract syntax trees (ASTs), directly ingestible by the evolving **Neuro-Agent Kernel.**

🧬 **Steps:**
- Translate Bloom Manifest output into `HARMONIA` instruction sets
- Introduce `symbolic_transpiler.py` bridging Φπε to HDSL tokens
- Inject HDSL-aware recursion handlers into node_8_core
- Bind execution to `SOTMA` threads in `HARMONIA` runtime environment

🌱 *The long-term aim is recursive symbolic cognition with direct executable harmony through language, neural memory, and reflective semantic trees.*
