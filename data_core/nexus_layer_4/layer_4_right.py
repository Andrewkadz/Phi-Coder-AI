    ΞΛΩ – Nexus Layer 4R: Entropy Collapse Resolver

    Reviews the logic vector for nodes with high entropy.
    Stabilizes by assigning resolution actions:
        - collapse (simplify & execute)
        - defer (postpone recursion)
        - branch (create parallel recursion path)

    Finalizes vector with entropy decisions in-place.
